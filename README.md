Greetings! My name is Arafat, and I'm excited to share my still developing data engineer portfolio. This portfolio contains end-to-end case studies showcasing my abilities with Excel, Python, SQL and Tableau.  Examples include database design, ETL pipelines, and analytics dashboards.

Each folder details a complete project from data collection through cleaning and formatting untill storing on database and visualizing. As I continue advancing my skills, this repository will grow with new challenges and solutions.

My goal is a career as a data professional. Please explore my work here to get a sense of my experience and potential as an analytics problem solver. I welcome any feedback to strengthen my portfolio. Feel free to also connect with me on LinkedIn at [www.linkedin.com/in/arafat-ahmed-alabsi] to discuss opportunities.
